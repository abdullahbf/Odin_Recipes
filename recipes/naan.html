    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It's easier than you think to make homemade naan. With this shortcut recipe, you need just a couple ingredients you may already have on hand. Learn how to make and use two-ingredient naan today. Prep time and cook time is 10 mins and 20 mins respectively.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â¼ cups self-rising flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix self-rising flour and Greek yogurt together in a large bowl until combined. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, adding more flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat dough into a rough 9x7-inch rectangle. Divide into 8 equal pieces. Lightly dust each piece with flour and flatten into a semi-rectangular shape, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a large skillet and place it over medium heat. Add 1 or 2 of the flattened dough pieces to the skillet. Cook until they begin to bubble and brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip over and cook an additional 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and repeat with remaining dough until all pieces are cooked. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
